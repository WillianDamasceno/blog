      <p>Hi, I'm Willian Damasceno, and I'm a software developer.</p>
      <p>I created this blog to get out of my comfort zone by learning anything that interests me and by sharing all this experience with my way of thinking.</p>

      <p>These are some considerations I think you should be aware of</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I will not waste your time</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>All the content is suposed to be consise and to the point.</li>
            <li>Every section in a post will informe you what it is about, so you can skip it if you want.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>English is not my mother language</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>There will be some typos through the content.</li>
            <li>
              Feel free to open an issue on
              <a href="https://github.com/WillianDamasceno/blog" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
              if you find any mistake.
            </li>
            <li>My mother language is Portuguese (Brazil), but I'm writing in english to reach more people and to get better at writing English.</li>
            <li>Since my 'writing style' is not very formal, to say the least, you can be sure everything you find in here will not be generated by AI.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I love transparency</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Every post will have links to sources and references.</li>
            <li>I will always give credit to the original author if some content is taken from their work.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>This website is open source</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can find the source code by

            <li>Since everything is free and open source, try not to use AdBlockers so I can keep creating content.</li>
          </ul>
