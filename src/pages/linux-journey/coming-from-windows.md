I've being a Windows user forever, and that's my first time using Linux. I searched a lot about Linux before intalling it in my machine, and I realized some interesting things:

- It takes time to learn how to use it.
- A lot of things just don't work.
- It's not harder then windows, it just a different.
- If you love a challenge, you'll love Linux.

I am not discouraging you from using Linux, but it is important to know that it is way different from Windows, and I am loving it.

## Choosing an OS

If you have time, motivation and mainly curiosity, trying Linux will feel like a game for you.

There are tons of different [Distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) you can choose to use it, I am currently using [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/) (It is not e recommendation).

I can't recommand any Distro because PopOS is the only distro I've used so far.

There is a list of Linux distributions on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions), but probably it will not help you if you did not decided which one to use yet.

I decided to use PopOS because:

- It uses [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu) as its base.
- Ubuntu has being developed for quite some time, so probably it's gonna be stable.
- Ubuntu is vary popular, so it's likely that I'm gonna find solutions faster on the web or by asking AI.
- These are other Distros I concidered using too (all based on Ubuntu):
  - [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/)
  - [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)
  - [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)
  - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop)

I will probably stick with PopOS for a long time, so I don't need to waste time reinstalling another Distro, then installing all programs again, then configuring everything again, well, you got the point.

The first benefit I can see is that now, my 9 years old machine is responsive again, I just can't believe it.

## A lot of things just don't work

By the time being, many Windows programs are not compatible with Linux, even using a compatibility layer like [Wine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)>).

This is the first challenge you face when you start using Linux, as you try to install the programs you're used to.

This is a problem mainly for common users and gamers, I don't mind it that much because most of the tools I use are [Cross-Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) or [CLIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

If you're busy with tons of tasks, or you don't like to spend a lot of time learning something, just don't use Linux. It's gonna be a headache and you'll just waste time not learn anything.
